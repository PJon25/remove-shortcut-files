# remove-shortcut-files

Probably you've encountered a worm that creates shortcut files (.lnk extension) 
when you insert your flash drive in an infected computer. To remove those shortcut files 
you need a lot of time to delete those files if there is many. This batch file will 
help you delete those shortcut files not only in your flash drive root directory 
but also in its sub-directories.
